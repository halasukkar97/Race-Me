# Race-Me
this is an assesment for Advanced Game Programming class where we have to create a simple game using C++ and DirectX.

in this Game i used cubes with images on them to create a simple Racing game, where the player needs to Reach the flag before the other car can.
the player can pick up coins and interact with trees and the component car.

to move the player around user:

                               W: forwared
                               A:left
                               D:right
                               S:back
                               
 there are two cameras inside but because of the lack of time when i had a problem with switching the camera inside the gameplay mood i couldnt fix it, but before starting the game if we switch the cameras it works just fine.

there is also a video in this Folder showes how the game look like and how it works.
